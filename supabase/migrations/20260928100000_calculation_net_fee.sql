-- The branch fee comes out of the practitioner's fee, not on top of it.
--
-- Confirmed with the branch: the remuneration is the professional fee alone,
-- and that is what the client pays. The branch fee is deducted from it, out of
-- what the practitioner receives.
--
-- calculations.total held the professional fee plus the branch fee, which is
-- a sum nobody pays. Nothing displays it any more, but a column called total
-- is the first thing anyone reporting on fees would reach for, and it would
-- overstate every one of them by the branch's share.
--
-- It is replaced by net_fee, what the practitioner keeps: the professional
-- fee less the branch fee. It is generated rather than stored by the caller,
-- so it cannot disagree with the two columns it is computed from, and existing
-- rows get the right figure without a backfill.
--
-- A branch fee larger than the professional fee would make that negative, and
-- is not a fee the branch can take out of the practitioner's, so it is now
-- refused. create_transaction takes both figures from the client, so this is
-- the only thing standing between it and a calculation that says the
-- practitioner owes money for the privilege of doing the work.

-- Recreated from 20260923100000 with one change: it no longer writes total,
-- which no longer exists, and does not write net_fee, which is generated. The
-- signature and return type are unchanged, so create or replace is enough and
-- the grant survives.
